5. Score: /

- [x] Application is divided to logical modules / layers. Like working with api it's separate module, as well as working with UI rendering, or working with an application state, etc. Better discuss architecture with a mentor before implementing. (/)
- [x] All the HTML-content is generated by JavaScript (body contains only one tag script inside). (/)
- [x] Application is SPA.(/)
