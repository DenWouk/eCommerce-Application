# eCommerce-Application

Welcome to our Ecommerce App! This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Project Overview

The Ecommerce Application is a web application built using Next.js, a popular React framework. It enables users to browse and shop for products, manage their cart, and complete secure transactions. Next.js automatically configures the tooling needed for React, including bundling, compiling, and more, which makes the React application interactive, dynamic, and fast.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone the project repository to your local development environment.

    ```bash
    cd ecommerce-application
    npm install
    ```

    or with yarn:

    ```bash
    cd ecommerce-application
    yarn install
    ```

2. **Run the Development Server:** Launch the development server to see the application in action.

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    or with yarn:

    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```
    
    The application should now be accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)


## Project Structure

The project follows a standard Next.js application structure:

- `pages`: Contains the application's routes and pages.
- `components`: Reusable React components used throughout the application.
- `styles`: Contains global styles and CSS files for styling components.
- `public`: Static assets like images and fonts are stored here.

## Available Scripts

The project includes various helpful scripts for development, testing, and maintenance:

- `npm run dev`: Start the development server and hot-reload changes during development.
- `npm run build`: Create a production build of the application.
- `npm run start`: Start the production server to serve the built application.
- `npm run lint`: Run ESLint to check for code quality.
- `npm run lint:fix`: Automatically fix ESLint issues where possible.
- `npm run format`: Format the code using Prettier to maintain consistent code style.
- `npm run test`: Run Jest tests to ensure code functionality and prevent regressions.
- `npm run test:watch`: Run Jest in watch mode to automatically re-run tests on file changes.

## Technology Stack

The Ecommerce Application is built on a modern and versatile technology stack, combining both frontend and backend technologies to deliver a seamless shopping experience. The core technologies used are as follows:

**Frontend**:
- **Next.js**: As a powerful React framework, Next.js empowers the application with server-rendered capabilities, ensuring fast load times and search engine optimization. Learn more [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) 

- **React**: The frontend is constructed using React, allowing for the creation of interactive and dynamic user interfaces, enhancing the user experience. Learn more [React + Next Documentation](https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project) 

- **TypeScript**: By leveraging TypeScript, the frontend codebase benefits from static typing, catching errors early in the development process and providing better tooling support. Learn more [TypeScript Documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/)

- **Tailwind CSS**: Tailwind CSS is employed as the utility-first CSS framework, enabling rapid frontend development with pre-defined utility classes. Learn more [Tailwind Documentation](https://tailwindui.com/documentation) 

- **ESLint**: ESLint ensures code quality by identifying and addressing code issues, enforcing consistent coding standards across the frontend codebase.

- **Prettier**: The integration of Prettier automates code formatting, ensuring a uniform and clean codebase for enhanced readability.

- **Jest**: Jest is utilized as the testing framework for frontend unit testing, validating the functionality and reliability of components.

**Backend**:

The backend of the Ecommerce Application is powered by commercetools.com, a headless platform that provides a scalable and secure foundation for managing product data, orders, and transactions.
